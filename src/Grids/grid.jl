     Grid{T,D}

A grid with coordinates of type `T`, e.g. `SVector{3,Float64}`, and dimension
`D`. The grid can be embedded in a higher dimension in which case the number
of indices and the number of components of the coordinate vectors will be
different.

All grids are expected to behave as a grid function for the coordinates.

`Grids` is top level abstract type for grids. A grid should implement Julia's interfaces for
indexing and iteration.

## Note

Importantly a grid does not have to be an `AbstractArray`. The reason is to
allow flexible handling of special types of grids like multi-block grids, or
grids with special indexing.
